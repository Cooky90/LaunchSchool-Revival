Methods defined with parameters, methods are called with arguments.

Loop is a method (Kernel.loop) Pass in do.. end block as argument.

Get used to a lot of passing in as an argument

i -= 3 , this is reassignment and + - * / are methods. I.e. i.-(1)

Think about what is output and what is returned i.e. hello world string and nil etc

Expressions are evaluated and have return values based on that evaluation

Scoping, remember inner can't outer, but outer can inner.

Each, map and select

Iterate through collection, yield to block, puts value or block parameter or whatever, each doesn't care about
return value of the block but map does!

Remember ints and symbols always occupy same physical space in memeory. Same objects always!

Remember += doesn't mutate, it is reassignment!
