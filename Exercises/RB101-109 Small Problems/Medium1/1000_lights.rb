# Problem: 
# A bank of switches, numbered from 1 to n.
# All lights switched "off" initially after the first iteration all the lights are switched "on".
# Second iteration, walk along and turn off 2 and 4.
# This process continues by turning off/on lights until n repetitions have been met.

# Examples:
# 1: [*][*][*][*][*]
# 2: [*][ ][*][ ][*]
# 3: [*][ ][ ][ ][*]
# 4: [*][ ][ ][*][*]
# 5: [*][ ][ ][*][*]

# # Data Structure:
# A hash would be most suited for storing the light status, lamp1,2,3,4,5 etc and their status held as the key.

# Algorithm:
# Create new hash. Create a key for each lamp which is an argument passed into the method.

# Iterate for n times.

# Each iteration, check to see if the iteration value is can be divided by the lamp number completely.
# If can be divided then the lamp status needs changing.
# 1 and 0 can be used to determine lamp status, or a symbol. Symbol's would be easier to understand from a visual perspective.

# Code:

def toggle_switch(current_status)
  current_status == :on ? :off : :on
